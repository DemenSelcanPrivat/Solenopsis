Solenopsis
==========

A commandline interface for deploying to Salesforce

Currently you will need to download the ant-salesforce.jar to the ant/lib/ directory.  We will be working on making this an automated process as well as phasing out the ant library for the MetadataAPI.

Installation
============

RPM: If you are on an RPM based system, you can run `make rpm` in the root directory and install the generated RPM

SOURCE: Just run `solenopsis` from the scripts directory to setup all of the configuration files and credential information


NOTE: Currently this project has only been developed and tested on Linux.  Patches and help for other platforms are always accepted.
