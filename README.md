# Solenopsis #

Solenopsis is a tool born out of necessity. With no good command-line tool to deploy Salesforce code with it was written to meet a need. Solenopsis is a combination of some ANT scripts to do deployment and Python scripts to do easily manage flags and other neat things like templates.

Right now, all testing and development has been focused on Linux. But patches are welcome to make it truely multi-platform.
